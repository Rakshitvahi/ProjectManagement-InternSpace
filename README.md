# ProjectManagement-InternSpace
This project focuses on comprehensive project management for InternSpace, a proposed web application to help students find short-term housing during internships and co-ops. Key deliverables include a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt chart, and RACI matrix. Financial planning was conducted using a weighted sum technique, achieving 95% cost estimation accuracy with NPV analysis. Risk mitigation strategies were implemented to reduce potential delays by 40%.
