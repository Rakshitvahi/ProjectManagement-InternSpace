# **Project Management: InternSpace**

## **Brief Description**
InternSpace is a project aimed at addressing the housing challenges faced by students relocating for short-term internships or co-ops. The project proposed a web application platform to streamline temporary housing solutions, aligning with the unique needs of students and property owners. Our team successfully delivered key project management artifacts including:  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
- **Gantt Chart**  
- **RACI Matrix**  
- **Risk Mitigation Plan**  
- **Budget and Economic Viability Analysis (NPV)**  

The platform ensures affordability, optimized resource allocation, and reduces project delays through tailored strategies.
